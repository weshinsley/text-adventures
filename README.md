:crossed_swords::keyboard::bow_and_arrow: Old-fashioned text adventure engine

This repo will document the dubious efforts of me and Luke as we learn to write a text adventure engine, of the sort that software
companies like Level 9, Infocom, Magnetic Scrolls and Scott Adams used to write around the 1980s. 

Objectives/progress:

* One-word commands. Directions NORTH,EAST,SOUTH,WEST,UP,DOWN (N,E,S,W,U,D)  - DONE
* INVENT (I) Inventory, and two-word commands: TAKE OBJECT, DROP OBJECT, EXAMINE OBJECT
* Flags/variables which are updated by the above commands.
* Allow above commands to be impossible if a certain flag/variable is not appropriately set.
